        <h2>About me</h2>
            <p><strong>Nice to meet you Google team!</strong> My name is Jay and I'm from Bogota Colombia <span role="img" aria-label="COP"> ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´</span></p>
            <p>I've been building digital products for <strong>9 years</strong>. I'm currently working in Mexico City as a Product Designer. Before moving to Mexico city I was a Design Lead in one of the most important online education platforms in Latin America, <a href="https://platzi.com/ux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="link">Platzi</a>.</p>
            <p>Platzi focuses on teaching programming but also on marketing and design. <strong> I was responsible for the product</strong> but at the same time gave 3 different courses about design, wrote articles, youtube tutorials and gave conferences in Mexico, Peru, and Bogota... all this about design.</p>
            <p>Because I was working a lot with the Mexican tech ecosystem, in 2016 I received a job offer to moving to the city and be part of a strategic design studio called 23 design.</p>
            <p>At <a href="https://23.design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="link">23 Design</a>, in 3 years I have had the opportunity to work with more than 20 startups and companies in industries such Real state, venture capital, fintech, Mobility, Banking, Music Business, e-commerce, marketplace, artificial intelligence, social.</p>
            <p>At nights also I organize Mexico's city official <a href="https://hellosketch.com?ref=heyjay.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="link">Sketch meetup</a> where designers and developers discuss ideas, new technologies and learn best practices about user interface and interaction design. </p>
            <p>I'm still giving courses, conferences and writing about design < span role="img" aria-label="COP"> ðŸ’ª</span>.</p>
